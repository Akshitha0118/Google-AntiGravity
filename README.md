# 🌀 Google Anti-Gravity Trick — Try It Yourself!

Have you ever seen **Google float into space**? 👀  
There’s a fun little trick called **Google Anti-Gravity**, where the entire Google page becomes weightless and elements start floating around as if there is **no gravity**! 🚀✨

## 🔍 What is Google Anti-Gravity?

Google Anti-Gravity is a playful web trick created by developers for fun.  
It simulates **zero-gravity physics**, making the Google search page UI float freely across the screen.

It’s not an official Google feature — it’s just a **cool JavaScript effect**!
